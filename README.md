# Analysis Plan
The dataset represents daily transfer volumes from GBP to ZAR for the latter three quarters of 2023.
***
I'll answer the following questions:
*  Describe the distribution that our daily transfer volumes follow.
*  What real-world cause do you think is behind this shape of distribution?
*  What are some of the implications that this distribution would commonly have on the analysis that you might do?
***

Have transfer volumes along this route changed significantly from quarter to quarter in 2023?. Determine that the observed differences from quarter to quarter are 'real' as opposed to being the result of background fluctuations.
***
Estimate the total transfer volume for October 2023, including measures of range and certainty
